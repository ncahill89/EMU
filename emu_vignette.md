## Introduction

In this vignette we obtain estimates of the modern contraceptive
prevalence rate (mCPR) for married women with package survey data and a
custom dataset of Estimated Modern Use (EMU) derived from service
statistics.

1.  [Format of EMU dataset](#emu)
2.  [Fit a one country model](#fit) `fit_fp_c`
3.  [Calculate point estimates for mCPR](#results) `calc_fp_c`
4.  [Plot the point estimates against the survey data](#plot)
    `plot_fp_c`
